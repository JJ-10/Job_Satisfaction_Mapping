+ Huge range of products that can fit into all different parts of an enterprise.

+ Strong revenue projections and big growth aspirations.

+ (Mostly) clear and transparent communications from leadership and senior management.

+ Open feedback culture, with regular employee surveys and check-ins—with employee survey results being published openly across the organisation.

+ Clear corporate strategy and goals, which trickles down to each employee through the V2MoM process.

+ Outstanding benefits package and above-average pay rates.

+ Open, sharing culture, with seemingly endless resources available.

+ Strong support network within the SE organisation and a willingness to help from other SEs.

+ Lots of internal resources around talent development and career development. 

+ A very generous education allowance (£5,000 in the UK) that can be put towards almost any course of your choice to help further your career and development.

+ Excellent treatment of a global workforce mostly working from home, such as home office allowances, extra days off etc.","- Anyone not in a direct quota carrying roles is treated as a second-class citizen, and the sales side of the business (e.g. account executives and sales leadership) is revered and constantly lauded on internal calls.

- Obsessive fixation on hitting quotas and revenue targets, which drives a culture of upselling (even when the customer doesn't really need it—despite their ""Customer Success"" value).

- It is difficult to relate the SE pay and bonus to company performance—despite ever-growing revenues and beating last year's results, this never really translates into a significant increase in pay/bonus.

- Murky promotion and career progression process that gets called out every year in the employee survey, but nothing really gets done about it. Hiring budget seems to be spent on bringing in more AEs (the quality of which varies considerably).

- The open, sharing culture has led to oversharing, and useful information and documents are scattered across a load of different sources (Google Drive, Quip, Slack, various Salesforce orgs)—with no single way of searching across all of these.

- Lots of internal ""noise"", which can distract from the day job (webinars, endless all-hands calls, irritating Slack channels etc).

- Internal culture can feel a bit cultish at times and there is a growing disconnect between the US and non-US workforce. You have to drink the Kool-Aid to get ahead.

- The internal Salesforce org (Org62) is a mess making it very difficult to navigate, Lots of duplicate data (e.g. accounts and contacts) across the organisation, which leads to internal fighting over territories/customers.

- The company swings between big corporate and scrappy startup: some internal processes are excessively bureaucratic and long-winded (e.g. requiring manager approval for a $5 software purchase), and elsewhere decisions are taken on a whim.

- Good place to meet new friends for life.
- If you know the right people within the company, will you be able to progress into other roles quite easily.","The following is based on my experience and it can be different in other department within the company:
- Targets are being set by (senior) management what are unrealistic due to the tools and programs we have to use (15+ year old, unreliable, and unable to get the right data). You are only able to reach the targets by pure luck or by fraud/bending the rules.
- Consequences are worse for not reaching your targets (read: losing your job) then committing fraud to reach the targets (read: a non-formal warning). 
- When reporting fraud being committed or a GDPR breach having held place to the correct departments, will you get an response that they do not got the proof to take further steps (even while you sent enough proof to start an investigation and or even take the steps needed), and will there sometimes even be an investigation started against yourself in how you were able to get the proof (read: retribution) instead.
- In the 5 years I've worked for the company, have I also reported several issues customers are having on a regular base; during the booking process, terms and conditions on our website etc. Most of them have never been picked up, and so are still an frustration to this day for the customers, even while one of the mottos of the Leadership team is ""Think Customer first"". And the points that were picked up (most of the times 2 or 3 years after it was first reported), went back to the way it was within the first software/process/website update, a few months/weeks later.
- If you are not willing to start an relationship with someone within higher up in the company, nor have family or friends within management or recruitment, then you will notice that it is (made) as good as impossible to progress any further.
 * as examples: 
E1: Person A worked already for 8 months in an secondment, when a permanent position came available. Due to the process (what is done in double standards, as some people get the full time automatically after an secondment, others have re-apply for the position) did Person A apply for the role again to be able to get the permanent position. This was only given to Person B, who never working it that role before, as recruitment told Person B had more experience within the role Person A was already working in.
E2: For a certain role were 3 position availed, during the recruitment did you had to do an test where you had to workout examples of the daily job and had to answer skills-set questions during an interview. For the test did Person A score 85%, Person B 80%, Person C and D both 60%. Person B was also told that all the info given during the interview was correct. Only did person B not get the job (as well D as C were friends of the recruiter/manager, know to every one)
- Due to the above do you got people in management positions, without having the skills or knowledge to be able to do that job. You will notice this quit easily with some of the responses you get from Team Managers. Senior Managers, Head of Departments: ""You do what you think is best, as you know more about the issue and process then I do"", ""If you say so, then it will be so."", ""So in al those years I worked here, I did look at the wrong numbers?(read: targets)""
- Even while it is being said it is an equal opportunity company, the recruitment department for the call center (where 500+ people work) is quite clear that their internal policy is not to hire people with an disability, and is also being made clear to people who start working within the department. (Maybe this as the call center has not even toilets or emergency exit facilities for disabled people).
- The pay is okay, but not great compared to what other companies offer now days.
- You are most of the time just a number within the company, easily replaceable and easily being ignored f you got any ideas, requests or questions. 
- As most people see the company the same way as I've seen it, is the overturn higher then an average supermarket. What causes a lot of good people to leave the company at the first possible option.",Manchester,53.4794892,-2.2451148,Urban with Major Conurbation

They tell you not to go in if you have sickness and/or diarrhoea as it is the cafe. Fine, BUT if you are off more than twice in a year you got a disciplinary!

So people had to go in otherwise they would eventually get sacked! It makes no sense.
Have a rule to keep customers safe, but punish the staff for it.

Also if you have a family member die, you don't get time off and have to use holidays or sick time but again you will get a disciplinary after the 2nd time if you use sick time.

I called in and was told to use sick time as I had no holiday left after a few days off, but they said if you do, you will get a disciplinary as you have been off sick once!
I had to sort all the death out and funeral but would be punished after my holiday ran out if I didn't go back in.
They don't care at all.

Probably the most inefficiently run company I have ever come across. The company is so big yet there is zero communication between departments.  It’s hard to believe that this is actually a functioning business.  ‘Bancs’ the CRM system that is used is so useless it’s like it is software that comes free with a kids magazine.  Constantly crashes, and is just useless to operate. The processes are utterly ridiculous. Figuring out the Da Vinci Code is simpler than a customer cashing in their pension , as that is how complicated it is. Multiple phone calls required from customers.  Correspondence that is sent out is not clear at all. There’s a reason that customers complain that Aviva are the worst pension provider. Horrendously adapted to the pandemic and consistently used it as an excuse for deficiencies within the company. Management are absolutely clueless. They say that care about Customer service, yet all their worried about is how long the call queue is.  The pay rate is atrocious for the amount that your expected to know. On that point, if you asked 5 different supervisors the same question to do with a policies terms and conditions, you would get 5 different answers. Absolute clueless from top to bottom of the company.

A very ‘swim or sink’ environment. That being said, if you are stuck on a piece of work, people are happy to guide you, and feedback is very detailed for you to learn and progress.
Very long work hours, advertise as having a great work life balance but this is definitely not true. Be prepared to cancel plans last minute as you may get a request at 5pm for a work that takes several hours. This happens regularly.
For an organisation that specialises in HR consultancy, pay is very under market (especially considering the extra hours you have to work, they even try and avoid increasing you pay in line with inflation), career progression is very slow (you can remain as an analyst for 2-3 years with no pay rise) and annual bonus is a joke (expect no more than £500)
The above two points result in a high turnover, within the executive compensation department and when someone leaves, they dont hire a replacement, instead they pass on the extra work to you. Leading to higher workloads.

You can book time off regularly or easily swap shifts with other people, although changing your set availability is hard to do.

Social life can be good: You meet a lot of life long friends there's also a team social which you typically get to pitch ideas for i.e. paintballing, work drinks.

Easy progression, I joined at 16 and was promoted with a pay rise by 17 and had opportunities to pursue management. Typically if you can do the job, follow most the regulations your work is recognised by management and you can get promotions. Of course this will depend on the management team from store to store, there have been cases where personal politics can get involved but I think it has gotten much better over the years.

Generally I don't regret my time there, it's a fun job you meet some nice people. At the end of the day if you leave by the time you're in your 20s the job shouldn't drive you insane.","Very very difficult to get more senior positions once you've reached the management. There are very few senior roles available for 1st Assistant, 2nd Assistant etc... and they are very competitive. Some people have been working at the same store for over a decade and still can't get the senior role they want.

Typical retail / service industry problems you get rude or threatening customers, it can be more frustrating when management won't take your side just to keep the customer happy.

Pay could still be better for management especially. With the amount of work that is asked of them £9/10 an hour is NOT enough - people in non-management positions get paid more at other retail stores.

The Ware Maufacturing site (probably similarly to other sites) was an established and old site in the business. It had a lot of people who started from one job and, through the years, have done a number of roles completely unrelated to their qualifications and exprience. It truly is a place where if you're liked, you're able to get a new job, a job that is often not even advertised. This applied to advertised jobs. The site seemed to have a lot of people in management roles that they were not qualified nor competent to perform well.

- Politics. The toxic, gossipy, soul-killing and time-wasting politics that drive people away. This seemed to be prevalent among middle management for whom someone's loss is their gain. Back-stabbing was also fairly common.

- Waste. The other side of the plentiful investment made by the company. Overpaying and underdelivering was a bitter reality for the site, which suppliers made the most of.

Access has been proactive throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, supporting staff to work safely from home, regularly checking in on team members, but on how they are - not just focussed on work and targets, so there is a genuine focus on wellbeing and encouraging staff to 'get away from their screens, take breaks, don't extend the working day to include the commute you used to have...'
It is refreshing to work for such an organisation where the first pandemic focus was to support our team to work safely and look after their physical and mental wellbeing (we have trained Wellbeing champions to support colleagues), then look immediately at how we could creatively support our customers (I am in the Health and Social Care Division), through innovative changes to the software to support early identification of symptomatic clients / residents / people supported, then how to ensure they are cared for appropriately and by staff who are reminded to follow Infection Prevention guideline and PPE requirements.
We enhanced our care planning solutions, added functionality to our rostering solution, created new Audits focussed on Covid-19 and Business Continuity, created a Visitor Booking solution for Care Homes and eLFY (e-Learning For You) courses to support the quick and safe onboarding of staff. We then ran webinars and created a support portal for customers to access best practice ideas, etc.
I'm proud of the work we do and the team I am part of. Our CEO and Chief Sales Officer have both created regular update videos to keep the whole team appraised of what the organisation is doing, how we are performing, along with reminding us to share how we are feeling, what help we need, so having that leadership sets the tone very positively for the whole business. 
If you are passionate about delivering and exceeding customer expectations, whether that is in the Health and Social Care Division or any other, Access is a great place to work.","Having been in care provider businesses, the NHS, Banking and Telecoms I think the biggest negative is the perception others have of software businesses and sales people.

Staff surveys are habitually delayed, cancelled, results not shared, or covered up. Maybe some locations are better than others but Reading and Stirling are and have been horrifically managed since M&G Pru handed over its staff to this inept company. If they didn't threaten staff about sharing their views like the KGB you'd see even more reviews like this on here. There was a witch hunt last time the senior HRBP read these reviews. 

The company are in the business of outsourcing, so why do their flagship systems not work without huge numbers of manual fudging yet to be fixed over a year later? Why do they sign up to new work (for a hefty fee) charging their clients for work then not providing their admin teams with any additional headcount and leaving them to drown in work?

Where is the business transformation model? Why doesn't anyone in any leadership know or talk about the road map or how or when anything will improve?

Why is it necessary to pluck staff and managers out of struggling business areas in to unfamiliar work with zero notice in a literal panic in order to fix yet more avoidable problems elsewhere?

Does this sound like a well run business where the leadership trust thier staff and vice versa, no? Indeed it's about as far from it as possible, and a horrible demoralising working environment, even when you work with good people as they too get ground down.

Unless you work on the checkout, this job is hard work and they like to think you're a robot. A usual day working on a department includes working stock, being called to the till to sort issues out, and being bullied by management. You are expected to unload all the pallets of stock which are usually 6 to 7 feet tall with around 30 to 40 boxes of stock, sometimes we can have up to three of these. If you are on your own, you are expected to at least unload around two pallets of stock in a 6 hour shift and get them on the shelves as fast as possible. It isn't that simple though, you are called to the till numerous times during your shift to get items with barcodes or sort pricing issues out. Within your 6 hour shift, you are also expected to clean your department which can be a hard task when you are pushed to get stock out as quickly as possible. 

Management are bullies. At my store, there was a particular manager who was vile for no reason, and in my opinion, shouldn't be in a role such as the one she is in. I heard from numerous colleagues that she had driven people out of the company due to the way she talks to people. She doesn't treat anyone with respect but expects you to continue being subservient. Management also makes errors such as ones regarding hours. Sometimes you aren't given your contracted hours on your rota and if they find out you haven't worked your contracted hours, they blame you for it even though it is their fault for not rostering the right hours, it's also a challenge to chase them up about it as they just do not care.

Chances are you won't get paid properly either. When the minimum wages goes up, they don't pay you the new wage until a month after and then they dont give you the missing amount in the next payslip.

Colleagues are horrible and sly for no good reason and think they're above everyone because they've worked there longer. You also get the typical gossipers who will grass you out to the managers the first chance they get.

I left after just 7 weeks because in that time I had been bullied by management and it just generally wasn't good for my mental health

Committees after committees after committees to tick boxes and say if something is red amber or green instead of actually fixing problems. Really poor senior management (some are real bullies). No interest for proper employee development. Keep talking about diversity and inclusion and yet they promote very few women. When promoting they don’t look for real quality of work but about how much BS the person can say. People who have done well and have stayed for many years are those interested to work within the lines of bureaucracy and do the minimum necessary.

Sales and Marketing strategy tends to dismiss female bias and lacks leadership believing strategy is threatened. Former leadership was supportive of sales and marketing strategy.

PR, Press and external Comms is a bullying strategy and has never been addressed... the turnover in PR, Press and Comms is a joke and former leadership has turned a blind eye because PR, Press and external Comms   has the ""right"" connections in media strategy. Concerning but true.

- managers are driven by profit
- managers don't have a regard for staffs personal life and availability, it is expected for you to be available even though you say that you are not
- it is is expected that you do more hours than what you are contracted to do because Asda doesn't want to give full time contracts. Doesn't benefit them and having full time staff makes, them loose money (due to more rights to those staff) so part time workers tend to be pressured to do overtime. 
- when staff whom were contracted to do nearly full time left, a replacement would not be hired. For example we had a full time staff leave and they were still not replaced even after a year has passed causing the current staff to substitute in to cover their shift. At some point other staff left and I ended up doing a job which would need 2 and half number of staff to complete. If you don't complete it you are viewed as lazy or not motivated. The blame is placed on staff even though everyone is requesting for more staff to be hired.

"Leicester, England",1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Some drivers are nice and helpful and that's it,"Make sure you have a smart phone as their satnav will take you to the wrong street at least two times a shift.
If you are a little late for work they will give your route to someone else, when you start at 4.30am they expect you to be out within an hour but then you have to find a loading bay, if you find a loading bay you have to find your parcels which most of them are in one place but then the others could be anywhere and you end up looking for them for three hours, and when you are in that early they sometimes are still taking parcels off the lorry as it turned up late and they wont tell you before you turn up so your waiting three hours to get your parcels yet again.
When there is high winds you still have to work at the same price. They expect you to deliver your parcels in the time slots given even though the satnav takes you to the wrong place, and as they dont keep you on the same route you cant get used to finding the difficult properties. 
If you cant find a property and bring the parcel back they will send you back out to deliver it even if that mean it's in a different city.
Working weekends is chaos there about 3 management on shop floor who everyone crowds around so your waiting ages to get some help, on the weekends you still have to deliver to businesses which they know are closed, so you could have 30 boxes to one business which is closed so you have to keep climbing over them to get to other parcels which then eats into your time and if you end up late delivering a parcel they wont care, they have no common sense as they expect you to wear safety boots while you walk from your van to your car and the reason they give is that if you get run over it will save you but in reality shoes are not going to save anything when you get run over, if you refuse to wear the boots walking to your car they will punish you. If you cant find a parcel they wont take it off they expect you to find it so while your searching for it for 3 hours they expect you to deliver on time, you can work 12 hour shifts.

Nothing else to mention","I used to work in Office Concierge as Elite for almost a year. It`s lack of organisation and communication between Operations and staff. On my second day, when I just came to the site, I received a call that I have to go and cover somewhere else, without even being trained. They changed my working sites and starting times at least 2 times per week. I didn't wake up because my alarm was ringing, I was waking up at 6 am because OC was calling me and changing my duties. 

It would be fine if they would change my site, but when they are calling me at 6:30 am asking to start at 8 am, when I need at least an hour just for travel, I have to go to work without even getting normally ready and having breakfast. 
To cover in Head Office was hell. You have to work from 8 am to 6pm, with 1 hour break alone. This site was too much for 1 receptionist, although no one cared. For this year, I called in sick once, because I had food poisoning. When I called in the morning to tell that I am really sick, it was said that I am not allowed to call in sick because there is no cover for me. Before lockdown, I was sent to 4-5 different sites where I have never even been, to cover lunch breaks. 

When I tried to explain that, I don't want to use public transport 4-5 times per day, because of the virus around, it was said ""Then you can walk ''. Of corse, I can walk from City to Mayfair, but it will take me an hour, although you give me 30 minutes to travel from site to site.

Even after lockdown I was still working 3 more days, what I guess was not even legal.

"London, England",3,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,Some very clever SME’s around. Great place to learn consulting with unlimited opportunities and a good set of clients.,"Work/life balance was the worst I’d had in 20+ years in consulting. Often working 5 days a week away from home and on the rare occasion I wasn’t on client site then was in the office - so missed children’s birthdays, parents evenings etc. I now see with COVID that 4 UK offices are closing with 100% WFH, so perhaps the pandemic has moved the firm in the right direction. 

Many of the Partners have come through the ranks from consultants - in some ways it’s great to see this opportunity, but unfortunately you’re left with a set of institutionalised Partners that have never worked anywhere else and are actually pretty inexperienced. This would explain some poor behaviours amongst some Partners that would not be accepted elsewhere. 

The partnership model also has its issues - this is not a hierarchical business with strong management top-down, but run more like a democracy. What you’re left with is a diluted strategy. For example some Partners wanted to do more with SAP, but others see the risks so the firm at the moment is generally not a hands on SAP System Integrator but more a Business Integrator - perhaps the recent acquisition of Keytree will change this.",City of London,51.5073359,-0.12765,Urban with Major Conurbation
"London, England",1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,The salary is good compared to other agencies,"I joined Hays as an experienced consultant who had previously a successful contact desk billing over 250k a year. The interview process was like the xfactor but was relatively ok. When I started we were told how lucky we were to have secured a place at Hays and that many other consultants across the country would dream to be in our position. Thought that was a little odd and this really was what most employees at the office believed, that they were inferior to others in the industry. We were set unrealistic and unachievable targets which we had to present the outcome off to the rest of the new starters, HR and the MD. As an experienced consultant I put a lot of pressure on myself to achieve these however when I didn’t and was faced with telling the MD, HR and the other new starters it really dented my confidence as failing to hit KPIs wasn’t something I was used to. However during the presentation it very quickly became clear that none of the other 10 new starters had hit their targets either and after speaking with other colleagues I found out that most people didn’t even come close to hitting their targets either when they started. It seems a strange process to put new starters through and certainly caused a lot of us undue stress. I do wonder why Hays haven’t looked at this and changed it as it was clear the targets were unachievable which was proved by not one person hitting them. I guess this would be a fair reflection of how the company is run, out of date and corporate. There was little training on the industry of your desk, I wasn’t trained on payroll despite having 5 people out working for me and the CRM system is hard to use, slow and isn’t fit for purpose. Consultants also don’t have their own numbers which is bizarre, there is an office number which one of 35+ people could answer. I left after 4 months and am now much happier, even if I was ‘lucky’ to have secured the opportunity there.",City of London,51.5073359,-0.12765,Urban with Major Conurbation

As this is such a huge institution, experiences can vary greatly. The general 'cons' of working in academia and in a large institution apply here too. Due to the size of the organisation and hierarchical structure, processes are very slow and cumbersome. It is often difficult to find the information you need as an employee due to the structure of the information online and the number of people that work here with different responsibilities that are not always immediately clear. I have heard that the working culture in some departments in terms of long hours and presenteeism is a problem, luckily this does not apply to me personally.

"London, England",1,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,- High commission (when they pay it).,"- I have never worked for an organisation where so many employees are consistently unhappy/stressed/under pressure.
- Huge divide between management/leadership team and rest of employees, with a ""Them vs Us"" culture and no accountability from management to help and support their employees, despite constant lip-service claiming otherwise.
- Disorganised, constant changing of rules with little forethought and implementation of new processes that seem to be put in place solely to make it more difficult to get paid sales commission. Some of these changes put in place retrospectively.
- Unnecessary layers of institutionalized middle management who have no clear purpose other than self preservation.
- A ""that's not my job"" culture, where employees from other departments are reluctant to work collaboratively as they are actively discouraged to work on anything that falls outside of their remit.
- Poor communication between leadership teams and their employees, making changes which are either not communicated clearly or communicated too late. Changes to the payplan took several months to be communicated to the staff they were affecting directly, with these changes in place for that entire period.
- Poor communication between departments, resulting in lack of direction overall and multiple people within the BT umbrella competing for the same customers.
- Constant chopping and changing of segmentation/allocation of corporate customers, making it challenging to build sales pipeline and inhibiting the customers experience. Some sales staff also had sales opportunities taken from them after months of work and given to another employee who was paid the commission despite never even speaking to the customer.
-Obsession with metrics and CRM dashboard information which encourages micromanagement of all employees activity. Employees then just end up gaming the CRM data to satisfy the ever changing KPIs, meaning that the data measured is increasingly worthless.

"London, England",2,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,"* The pay is average for London. There are some benefits like discounts etc but they are nothing to write home about
* If you are luck enough to be placed in a good team, there's the chance to work with some decent tech and good practices
* A longstanding business that's probably not going away any time soon, even if they are in decline over a longer timeframe. Your job is probably safe for 10 years at least
* Sainsbury's diversity and inclusion efforts are surprisingly good. They're pretty active in supporting different backgrounds, educating colleagues and also speaking up if colleagues act insensitively. However, this only goes so far: senior leadership is still very overwhelmingly white, middle-class, English and male.","* Sainsbury's are one of those business that like to say they are agile, but really all the planning above developer level is waterfall, with multi-year plans, ""enterprise architects"" who don't code prescribing details years ahead of implementation. Short term planning basically doesn't happen. Imagine all the downsides of waterfall with no benefit, plus no joined up thinking at a lower level
* There is a _huge_ resistance to software practices that have been considered standard in most other businesses for decades at this point, including: automated testing, CI/CD, agile, UX testing (with actual users)
* Lots of people-churn, in the projects I've worked on, average tenure seems to be around six months
* There's a pervasive attitude of ""software developer == code typer"" in the company, meaning that feedback, ideas, solutions etc from lowly developers are ignored in favour of (often badly thought out or bizarrely ill fitting) ideas from middle-manages with no real-world experience
* Middle-management, eg. tech leaders on projects are, in my experience, either non-technical people with some management skills but who fail to understand technical requirements and caveats, or have been ""out of the game"" for too long and only understand very outdated practices
* Senior management are - to say this neutrally - out of touch. There are regular all-hands meetings with senior management, however the tone from senior leaders is extremely condescending, especially when answering people's concerns regarding Brexit, Covid, ways of working and the future of the company. Senior leaders (who are all white and middle-aged, 90% male) sit in their home offices overlooking massive gardens in their countryside home, telling the staff who are sat in bedrooms in house shares how we're ""all in this together"" 
* Covid response has been mediocre. I feel like the company has done the bare minimum to support staff. For example, there are allowances for equipment to work at home like a mouse, monitor, etc, but the spending limits are so comically low as to be useless, eg. a maximum of £7 for a mouse, which buys basically the cheapest non-ergonomic mouse from Argos with staff discount and that's it. The company's lack of support for staff who have family overseas and who have asked for permission to work from abroad is appalling. They have refused to grant permission and refused to explain why they won't allow this. The overall feeling is that the company is run by mean-spirited bean counters who only care about staff wellbeing in the sense that high staff turnover costs them money.
* The company's efforts for social causes like Covid and the environment are ""good enough"" and the company could do a LOT more. ""Carbon neutral by 2040"" is a pathetically unambitious target, and exists solely so the company can look like they are doing something.",City of London,51.5073359,-0.12765,Urban with Major Conurbation

Other than that, from an engineering standpoint, I really see no other pros.","I really don't know where to begin...

- Internally, it's a mess of custom-built systems, the majority of which are half-broken. You better follow the few happy paths the systems expect otherwise you are doomed. 

- These custom-built systems, typically have a terrible UI/UX in 80s/90s style. Lacking basic but obvious elements such as a simple link to homepage on the service ""logo"".

- The documentation for things are obviously not up-to-date, they are patchy, if at all present. People there don't know what ""reference documentation"" means. When you ask something, they WILL give you vague answers (if you are lucky to GET an answer). You fill find that most people are busy...doing what? I don't know. Certainly NOT focused on simplifying/improving things. I suspect the majority are there to keep their position/role close to themselves. Keep in mind many people are there since +3/5/10 years. Many often openly say their skills are not transferable, which means they either stay there or a lot of effort will be required for them to go elsewhere. 

- The internal services have half-baked and/or badly-baked RESTful-ish APIs (if/when at all available). Again without documentation. 

- Infrastructure as code? Forget it. Terraform is used internally but the in-house built custom resources are broken and or implemented in a bad way. Forget all the goodies Terraform gives you. 

- As a developer your life will be miserable. You will have to live with having to login into a remote desktop, and then maybe onto another box from there. You will have a hard time when it comes to managing your keyboard key mappings. Especially if you are on a mac, using a Windows remote desktop, then onto a Linux box. 

- As a developer your life will be more miserable. Forget using the latest version of IntelliJ or Pycharm or VSCode. You are lucky if you get to use a version from 4 years ago or longer. 

- As a developer your life will be miserable 5x. There is an infinite amount of processes, road blocks, blockers etc when it comes to creating VMs, deploying things, etc. Their internal ""cloud services"" are the worst I have ever seen. You thought AWS/GCP's UIs/functionalities were bad? Don't be naive. Think twice.

- The internal tooling truly is awful. Skype and Symphony (like Slack, but 10.000 times worse) are used for messaging. Don't get me started there... Then people tend to copy&paste CLI commands/etc into email threads. A true joy when it comes to reading these threads. Ah, and you will have to spend days to fight with Microsoft Office email filtering rules because you will be flooded with meaningless automated email notifications. I am surprised they use Zoom. I believe the pandemic kind of forced them to, in a way...

- If you want to run something on a box, you are doomed to go through MANY hoops and bumps. You thought Kubernetes was bad? They have a custom system which will make you cringe when it comes to working with it. It's bad, and it does not work. 

- Did I mention the internal tooling is terrible? Even at Apple which is a very secretive company use Slack. This alone must boost productivity by MILES. Instead Goldman Sachs uses 2 of the worst tools. Having conversations with people which involves code is the worst of the worst. This is true also for conversations happening over email (Outlook formatting and copy&paste capabilities...ugh!)

- There are people who are literally afraid of criticising the internal state of things and/or saying negative stuff about the company processes/services/etc (which clearly don't work and MANY complain about). They are afraid of saying due to potential retaliation by the company. Read that again. You got that right. 

- There's tribal knowledge everywhere you turn. The internal Confluence spaces are more often than not useless. They are incomplete. Badly written. 90% of time you will spend an absurd amount of time trying to figure out where is the documentation for something and/or how something works. Because guess what - that ""something"" is a custom thing somebody thought it'd be good to build (bonus hunting anyone?). Add all this to the fact the person that *maybe* knows is on the other side of the globe. So good luck with that. Maybe in a week worth of back-and-forths via Skype/email you will get a definitive answer (because people WILL give you inconsistent and/or vague answers).

I am seriously impressed by how such a behemoth of a company is in such a bad state when it comes to technology. And to think that billions of dollars flow in and out of there. It's all kept afloat by a non-negligible amount of minions which maintain servers and do manual tasks...30% of which could be easily be automated out if only one would follow simple, basic and GOOD engineering practices.

Not everything is bad, sure. But don't be fooled by those who will try to paint you a rosier picture. As the CEO said, it's a bank and not a tech company. If you are one of those who value collaboration, being able to look into other people's code, send PRs, streamline/automate processes, remove barriers, etc. This is definitely not the place for you.

Money was no better if you were a supervisor, they made 20p more than a senior but they were told to be ‘mini managers’ without the benefit of a managers salary. There was little training given, you learnt on the job and taught be people who were already stretched think while management sat upstairs. Progression was kept for those who sucked up to management and not those who were better or more competent at the job.

Pay is varied between different department areas, but you can see there are efforts to try and do the right thing. There is increased transparency on what we do well, and what needs work on. It is a proud firm with a rich history of delivering world class services and support to clients.","Mercer is a bureaucratic business with a complex structure. It lends itself to poor and slow decisions being made. Often the business chokes itself unnecessarily because of this. The business would benefit from a more flat structure, allocating budgets to departmental heads who can then make quick decisions on how to run the business area. It would make the business far more agile and adaptable throughout the economic volatility we see today. Those closest to the clients understand the challenges that need addressing, and talent management requirements. My overarching concern with the structure is that at the very top and bottom of the business we are seeing alignment in terms of values, culture and strategy, but we have a lot of out of touch, stale and self-serving senior managers and partners who do no have the firm or it's peoples interests are the fore. Instead, it is about self promotion, and as a result, they are poor leaders, out of touch and leave many feeling resentful to work here. The go to market strategy is being undermined by these people as they often instruct their teams do underhand things in order to gain additional revenue. This is not a client centric thing to do and is often brought up in client conversations. Reducing reliance on commission and charging a flat fee with a proposition bundle will improve the perception of the value we offer. If we contracted for 3-5 years, then 

Lastly, in most areas of the business we have specialist on health and risk, rather than being multi-disciplined. Our competitors have moved away from this model as it is inefficient. A client does not want to see 3-4 people on a single call to discuss a renewals. The different teams also are poor at communicating and it does not lend itself to having strategic conversations with clients. Some large corporate clients I think warrant it, but aside from this, it is not needed and it not wanted by clients. It makes us appear outdated and fragmented. The majority of those colleagues who I speak to are unable to have any kind of strategic conversation with clients about this as their knowledge is too narrow, and ultimately, their line managers don't focus on the other benefits as they are not remunerated to care about it.",City of London,51.5073359,-0.12765,Urban with Major Conurbation

"London, England",1,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,"- Top-class design team. It's a shame that some good people have left or are leaving.
- Great salary.","- The mission is a lie - Babylon focuses on delivering tech products to big health org (mostly Insurance providers) with the aim to reduce costs to THEM. But it's up to these orgs to reduce their cost to the end-user. Where is the data that shows that we are closer to achieve our mission?
- Senior leadership has no experience with tech - The CEO and other people in C-Suite has no experience with tech or managing product organisations. Their decisions are random and dictatorial creating a chaotic environment.
- There is never time to build the right thing - The business is led by the commercial team and all their short-sighted deals. They decide what goes to product roadmaps. Product teams then need to work in a rush to make sense of the commercial deal and try to build a solution that either meets the user needs or the partner needs. What do you think a CEO who is ex-Goldman Sachs is going to prioritise?
- Design Leaders mysteriously disappear - Product Directors, Heads of Design and Chief Design Officers get fired after doing something that contradicts senior leadership. 
- Poor culture - Long and stressful hours. We say that 1 day at Babylon feels like 1 week, and 1 week feels like 1 month, and 1 month feels like a year. If you care about your mental health, look for somewhere else.
- Lack of transparency - No transparency from Senior Leadership or leadership on what decisions have been made and why.

"London, England",5,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed my 4 years working at Morrisons. It is a great job as a student and I felt really disheartened having to resign but I guess everyone eventually moves on in life. Here are the pros:
-A bright, energetic team! You will get a long with everyone from the second you start working at Morrisons
-The stores overall working environment is brilliant and the Managers and Head Office listen to all staff and implement views and suggestions
-Regular breaks which is a huge advantage considering the amount of time your on your feet and the constant walking around the store. It is a very fast paced job!
-Great hourly rate of pay which is set to increase! We were also offered lots of bonuses especially to reward our hard work during the coronavirus pandemic. Morrisons cared a lot for their employees during the pandemic. We were given lots of support especially financially! PPE was ready for us immediately. Morrisons reacted very quickly and very effectively towards the pandemic. Moreover, 95% of their temporary staff hired during the pandemic have got permanent positions within the company. Due to current unprecedented times, this is a lifeline for some. 
-10% staff discount which rises to 15% occasionally. During Christmas, we got 20% staff discount at one point. In addition, we also used to get free food (mostly bakery, fruits and vegetables) to reduce food waste and Morrisons are working really hard to reduce their environmental impact which I love! You are allowed free hot drinks on your shift as well.
-Career progression is great. Morrisons really love organic growth! I was offered promotions to Shift Leader but due to educational commitments I had to decline them. I know one person who has worked in Morrisons for 8 years. They went from a Customer Assistant to an Assistant Manager. 
-The training and development you receive is very structured and critical. I have gained a lot of skills and knowledge from this. Moreover, I have seen other colleagues being motivated to apply for Degree Apprenticeships and Graduate programmes which Morrisons offer
-Managers are very thoughtful and considerate. They consider everyone's external commitments (especially for working Mums or University students) I have never had issues with my shifts. Stores are really organised.","Despite working here for 4 years, I cannot think of much. Everything went well for me and many others. There are only little cons:
-Lots of overtime offered. This maybe a pro for your bank account but eventually it does affect your social life. Personally, as a student I did not mind working almost triple my hours 1 week as I needed the money
-Sometimes, workloads could be overwhelming due to the nature of the job. When everyone was panic buying, I was on the tills for 3 hours straight! 
-Some customers can be really rude and aggressive. I have seen someone fight with the security once because they did not want to wear a mask! Ridiculous!

The sick leave and maternity pay was good. In general we had lots of good choices for frames and lens’ with customers. I really enjoyed the job when I first started as it felt like we really cared about people’s well-being.","Towards the end of my time here during the pandemic when they decided not to bring managers back into store, optical assistants were being overworked and underpaid; being expected to do a store managers job for zero pay increase this led to incredible stress and a day where my entire team cried because of how overwhelmed they was. 
Upper management were constantly making changes to the prices and procedures without consulting their staff on the ground which led to things that were not beneficial to the customer or the staff which clearly someone sat in an office who had no experience of optics had designed.

Lack of training meant there was many who could do one thing but not another and it led to a high turnover of staff as they felt inadequate when they couldn’t do things that they could if they had just had some training. 

The wage for the job you was doing was very small and actually one of the lower paying of opticians. No bonuses or commission made it feel as if it wasn’t worth it. 

The uniform was one of the worst things about the company, cheap polyester uniform that was constantly splitting or tearing and once it did break you could be waiting months before getting a new set. A customer once described it to me as looking militant and I couldn’t disagree with them. 

In my time there plenty of staff left but non were replaced which meant at times you had three people for three clinics and as soon as you had a walk in it meant everyone was rushing around without being able to give proper attention to the customer.

The rule of being stood up all day meant that we looked as if we was doing nothing when customers walked in when actually we had ten jobs in hand that we couldn’t deal with just so we looked as if we were ready to go for the next customer. 

If there is jobs going at any other opticians I would go there over boots, their work politics gets to be too much and you feel very inferior within the company; there is zero room for progression at most points but especially now as they are making staffing cuts.",City of London,51.5073359,-0.12765,Urban with Major Conurbation

Berwick in particular has a warm and supportive culture with a fantastic CEO, Richard Love, who really cares about his staff. I can't speak for the rest of Odgers however. The company overall works hard to develop its culture, we have bake sales, whole company assemblies once a week, D&I festivals, extravagant Christmas parties and away days. The company has dealt with the pandemic well, particularly in how it has handled working from home and the promise to maintain this flexibility in the future. There has not been any pressure applied to return to the office, the approach from the SLT has been very human and caring throughout. Cannon St office is in a brilliant location. Work life balance is very much respected, very rarely do I have to work out of hours and am not expected to take my work home with me.","There is a sense of inequality and hierarchy at times between support staff and fee earning staff that is not malicious, just ingrained into the culture within some of the longer standing members of staff. The company is also trying to catch up when it comes to D&I but isn't currently providing any financial backing to this and is instead mostly relying on an employee driven D&I programme. The company has a reputation for being old fashioned and right wing and doesn't do enough to dispel this image, the board and trustees in particular are very outdated in their ideas and opinions.

Very little of your actual performance or feedback from direct line managers taken into account. Building your  ‘personal brand’ is the primary concern of the company from day one, which encourages people to cosy up to management who will help them through promotion, rather than focussing on building up useful skills. 
- incredibly competitive and toxic culture, particularly in ACG. To be expected when you are ranked against one another during performance review 
- analysts have no say in shaping their career - schedulers and management only care about charge-ability.  If you turn down unsuitable roles you will be penalised. 
- analysts are taken advantage of by senior staff eg forced to work on clients without a chargeable code, which is then used against them at performance review 
- questionable management of the recent redundancy process - Accenture now having to rehire multiple roles, no senior management pay cuts etc 
- it looks bad to be throwing countless freebies at your employees whilst laying off 6% of the UK workforce

- Access to discounted Accenture share; 
- Flexible parental leave.
- Great opportunity to get certified in anything. They offer a range of services and tools to enable that.
- If you're a recent Graduate, don't mind climbing the corporate ladder, love to work anytime of the day and evening, you'll feel at home.","1. Full of office politics;
2. You find yourself living to work rather than working to live;
3. When it comes to performance review time, it gets quite stressful because, it's a sales speech, and most of the times, the one who has actually worked and contributed more don't get promoted, at the end of the day is 'how well the managers or senior managers in your bubble know you';
4. Managers feel like gods and can get very disrespectful and inconsiderate, in many occasions, they've put people on performance improvement simply for not wanting to work overtime or wanting to leave a project they're not happy with;
5. Arrogant leadership;
6. Mediocre pay;
7. Coming from a minority background, On three occasions I've had white managers and team leads happily saying the 'N word' in front of me while others just laughed, which goes without saying the feeling of disrespect felt (Being new and junior in the company I was afraid to speak out), on a different situation, a team lead said to me 'don't go for white girls they don't tend to like big-nosed people' while asking for my dating situation;
8. People at senior level than others feel the need to step/look down on people;
9. You'll find yourself knowing more than someone at a higher level than you, which goes back to point number 3;
10. Unnecessary extra-curricular work which is crucial to getting promoted, the more you do the better, and you easily find yourself not having time for actual client work;
11. Leadership don't care about juniors of Level 11-12, have once been around a group of managers in a pub, a group of junior colleagues (level 11-12) passed by to say 'Hi' after they're gone a manager loudly says 'F-word TAGs' (TAG is the denomination for anyone who's of associate/analyst level). All other managers, team leads, Senior managers simply laughed;
12. No humanity, if you're lucky enough you find yourself in great projects with actual nice people but it's extremely rare, it's easier to find a crypto-wallet full of Bitcoin on the side of the road.
13. Have worked on a Financial services' project with a very lovely and friendly group of Indian developers on ICT visas, the senior managers were the true definition of bullies, on one occasion calling one of the developers (who's around 38-40 years old) dumb and useless in front of the team. Which goes back to point number 5 and 8.
14. Leadership are like presidential candidates, they know how to use their words to keep you at ease.
15. Get ready to be a Yes-Man in order to be promoted

Final Tip: 
 - It's not about working hard, just know your people, make yourself known to managers and senior managers; 
 - Talk a lot even if it doesn't make sense;
 - Make sure you show the personality that's ready to step or disrespect others anytime, it'll show to leadership you're ready to lead.",City of London,51.5073359,-0.12765,Urban with Major Conurbation

If you have a good relationship with senior management, you have the opportunity to move between different divisions, try new job roles and progress quickly within the company.

There seems to be an acceptance of legacy IT systems and processes that have impacted both individual and business-level efficiency.

The acquisition of companies over the years appears to have clouded Equiniti's focus and has led to funding being stretched thinly across numerous divisions.

"Exeter, England",1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Pay is decent except no overtime rate.,"So firstly they lied to most people who joined within the first year of the RDC opening during interviews as they told most of us things like we would be working 1 weekend in 4 (you actually work 3 weekends in 4). We were told we get a £1 a year pay rise and we are currently getting 40p a year which is now capped after 3 years at £10.50 (new starters reach £10.50 in a year now). We were told we get lots of benefits like cheaper contracts with EE and cinema tickets which was a lie.

The place is also run by senior managers who want nothing to do with warehouse staff and care only about productivity and not staff health or wellbeing. Below them are the ATMs who are so stressed due to senior management that they often take it out on warehouse staff and charge hands. The charge hands (which no longer even get £1 extra an hour) are dropping like flies and stepping down so quickly that they are forced to continue to do the charge hand role and are on the verge of mental break downs until they can convince some gullible sap to replace them and be a whipping boy for managers for no extra pay.

HR and recruitment are always scratching their heads and asking how they can improve the absolutely shocking staff turnover they have but don't seem to notice that the warehouse management seem to like the staff turnover as it is easier to convince new starters to work stupidly quick to achieve non existent progression. 

Injured at work and not your fault? Better hope you have sick days left because they aren't going to pay you and you'll need to get a union or solicitor involved to put in a claim to recoup lost wages. Also they have a tendency to lie to the council to make any accident seem like your fault to avoid guilt and then make you chase your own tail for cctv footage.

The rota patterns are terrible and always have been. Old pattern involved us working 7 days in a row sometimes with only one day off. Now we have working weeks of 5 days in, 1 day off, 4 days in, 1 day off f then another 5 days in. It kills you! And they still expect you to maintain a high performance target! 

Performing well or quickly means nothing to these people. You work harder they raise your targets. Meet those targets and they raise them again and will keep raising them until you can't achieve their targets then they will threaten you with disciplinary actions to push you to kill yourself attempting to hit their target or it pushes you to leave. You also won't get anywhere in the company by working harder as it seems to be if your face fits and not performance. Slow lazy people get easier jobs so they don't hurt their performance figures and certain people regardless of performance barely have to do any work.

As a fan of Lego all my life, I felt no shame or discomfort making sales. Lego is something you can happily recommend to others so long as they can afford it.

The store generally attracts open-minded and fun potential employees and customers. You'll find yourself making good friends there with the sales associates and regular customers.

You will gain a lot of self-confidence here. Whilst the job role of always having to put on a big smile and a circus-act can seem unfitting and annoying at times to your personality, you really see that happiness reflected in the eyes and faces of customers and it does make your day. 

Hey, the employee discount is pretty nice.","As the headline suggests, it's just retail. Having to deal with Lego and friendly customers pacifies your experience and makes it bearable. 

Pay is low, not that there's anything much to expect out of a sales associate in retail. 

You will be berated by managers and supervisors over minor issues. You leave and begin shifts in fear, paranoid you've done something wrong. 

You will turn up to shifts only to have managers tell you in a briefing that 'it's your fault that we're not meeting unrealistic sales numbers'.

You aren't allowed to talk with fellow sales associates on the shop floor. No really, not even five seconds of it. Managers and assistant managers will come running to get their buzz out of berating you for it.

Managers live in fear of senior management/corporate and only push the blame down on to you. It's quite laughable when you're told to be on your 'best behaviour' because Senior Management is visiting, and when they do arrive, just based on first-impressions, they're nothing to write home about. As I said, systems of fear.

NPS system which rates you based on the reviews from customer survey feedback (the link on their receipt). A system which is already inaccessible, inconvenient and meaningless to most customers actually determines how your managers review your performance. So you need to beg customers to fill it out at the till otherwise it would 'seem' as if you're not even doing your job correctly. Surely the managers should be able to assess your performance with their own eyes and ears on the shop floor. 

You'll have to do an hour of 'greet' at the door every shift which is outdated and mind-numbing. Admittedly, having been greeted before, I can understand why it sets a good mood, but it really isn't a necessity and can really drive down the mental wellbeing of your staff on their shifts.

Delivery shifts are tiring and set unrealistic targets. Sadly it's the only time you'll get to be social as it's all mostly back-of-house.  

As with most retail stores, the music choice is terrible.

I do often feel nostalgic about working there, but I only realise now that I just miss the friends I made. I am glad to be away from everything else. As for the Lego bit, I can enjoy that from the warmth of my own home.",City of London,51.5073359,-0.12765,Urban with Major Conurbation

This supervisor is a sly individual, at face value, looks as though is a pleasant person but behind your back, will speak nasty of you (NO ONE IS SAFE - TRUST ME) Very manipulative, and likes to use her ""power"" and experience against you and applies the 'one rule for you, another rule for me' move with all. 
-Said Supervisor has also leaked very personal and sensitive information to employees about an emplyee which is against policy and completely wrong in all ways. 
-Expects you to be at the store 30 mins before and sometimes over an hour after the store shuts without pay. 
- A lot of Favouritism and Work politics (Don't say I didn't warn you)
- If you'd like a good reference once you eventually leave the company (I'd be surprised if you stay longer than 6 months but if you do, power to you brother/sister) 
don't even bother requesting from them... unless you end up somehow in their good book, part of their gang. 
- Don't trust anyone... 
- If you want to cry at least once a month, this is the place for you 
- Pay is a joke for the work and things you have to put up with 
- Training opportunity is laughable, what training?
-You want to work your way up in the company? Good luck.

Their approach to mental illness has been very accepting and they have dedicated 'mental health first aiders' who are excellent.","Bonuses have not paid out to employees on the lower end of the scale (bonuses still paid out to Directors), but this was unexpected and poor results were not communicated properly to staff, until they were informed they would not get a bonus or pay rise.

I would not recommend working here if you are not super-confident, management will happily tell you that you are replaceable and should be grateful for your job. My experience at SJP has been one of manipulation, especially if you feel you are worth more than you are getting treated. Working in the Partner Services division, you are told that 'Partner is King' and you should do anything they ask of you and accept any abuse you might get from them over emails/telephone.

SJP do not value their staff and regularly talk down to their hard-working employees. They do not seem to value the importance of rewarding and recognising hard work, instead expecting it and disciplining anyone who is not giving 110%. 

Unfortunately, I have seen many employees made to feel they could not find a job elsewhere and feel they have to stay. There can also be a very bitter atmosphere for recent Graduates, or people keen to seek out development opportunities, stemming from jealousy or an inability to accept change.

- Good place to develop new skills if you can keep up with the workload, quite often involved in projects that expose you to new processes and practices outside of your normal area of work, you gain a good understanding of how the whole business works and the impact your area has.

- Great finance team with strong leadership and clearly defined policies and practices.

- Great people to work with overall.

- Flexible working and have been quite solid when it comes to home working.

- City centre based offices (Both Leeds and London), easily accessible and nice environment, open offices, no real fighting over meeting rooms, new equipment (connecting TV to laptop can be a tad finicky)/","- Terrible habit of senior leadership dictating how something should be built, despite never using/never will use a system, and not involving the people who use this system on a daily basis. In some areas of the business there is a huge gap between the technical and functional (business) team, leading to a lot of wasted time in project meetings. It is extremely difficult to call something out (even when you and several other experts of the system are screaming that X wont work)as it will get brushed aside by more senior staff, they claim challenging something is seen as a positive, but it really does cause issues.

- Remedyforce (shudders is disgust) is used as our primary ticketing system, and is run with an iron-fisted call centre style of management which has led to several issues throughout the systems and processes that are used in Burberry. Employees are judged and rated based on how many calls they miss, the number of cases resolved or re-opened etc, and senior leadership doesnt seem to care about the why, and will just pressure managers and team leaders to simply increase the percentages, quite often this has led to team leads being micromanagers. This has led to little incentive amongst several teams for them to implement permanent fixes, these take a long time and coordination from multiple teams which will not be rewarded because the ticket about it will be out of SLA, whereas you get a solid pat on the back for putting in a quick cheap bandaid fix because the ticket will be in SLA.

- Low salaries that do not meet the industry average couples with the expectation that you should work beyond your remit where there is little reward or recognition for doing so has led to a high turn over for talented staff.

- Employee engagement surveys are the same every year, there is a disconnect between staff and SLT, many feel under appreciated and overworked.",Leeds,53.7974185,-1.5437941,Urban with Major Conurbation

You're dreaming if you're expecting to grow financially with them...

You will be expected to do a LOT beyond your customer engagement (up to 20 hours a week and sometimes more) with very little recognition. The joke is that you will hear a lot of music about work life balance...

Huge focus on a single subjectively negative appraisal over 10s of positive client recognized impacts. This will also impact your promotion and salary increase, if it ever happen (hope you will not be shocked with 50£ and 100£ hikes)

If you have an alternative offer, please do not overvalue Deloitte as a brand or company. Never take their offer if it's not better than the competition as you will be squeezed for every single penny you will be getting.

Be very careful with the HR and recruitment team, they are expert MANIPULATORS. They will put every pressure on you to make you feel like you will be losing a lot by no immediately accepting an offer that is not aligned with what you want. The recruitment process might take 9-12 months and they will almost seem to be proud of it, but they will ask you to think over a scrap offer overnight hinting that they have a lot of applicants waiting for the role...

Not aligned to what other consultancies do, You will be expected to pay you lunch, drinks and coffees even if you are travelling to the south pole to deliver a client project.

Don't expect to have the right support to grow. You will be thrown in the middle of the pacific and expected to reach California by yourself. Very poor coaching and average/limited training offering.

Few of my colleagues reported that they have seen a last minute change to the offer bringing the salary and the grade to lower levels while they have been promised that they will be able to get it back in 1 year and as you might be thinking: Dream on; no one of them have been able to get what he expected in day 1 after the 1st year. I came to infer that this is some sort of practice to source high caliber profiler for lower salaries, get them into clients for very high rates (sometime 2 grades higher) while they will never feel that on their salary, promotion or even recognition.

"London, England",1,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,None that I could list.,"While the rest of the company manages its operations on a shoestring, the IT department still believes that ""BAT has too much money""; that standpoint drives the whole department behaviour in terms of performance, culture and integrity.

Regarding performance, the vast majority of IT projects fail miserably. When I was working in that department, the joke was that BAT were the world champions of failed SAP projects. The reason is, failure is not seen as an issue in that department, confidence and arrogance are valued much more than competence. And, of course, your ethnicity: woe be to those outside of ""CANZUK"" + (white) South Africa.

As a result, the culture is based on blaming others for one's own failures, and hijacking your neighbour's successes. People at the top are low-level technicians whose only skill is to relish in abject subservience to their superiors, unable to see the big picture while convinced they are ""leaders"". Bullies flourish within BAT IT department, and attain the highest positions.

And, as ""BAT has too much money"", the way vendors are selected and managed is particularly worrying. Again, they are not selected with the business' interests in mind. More expensive, less performing vendors are preferred over more efficient and cheaper ones, even when the choice implies a huge risk to operations. Or useless technologies are purchased to allow the IT ""architects"" to garner their resumes with that specific skill. Sometimes vendors are selected based on the ""cultural fit"", meaning the nationality of the vendor - pure Brexit style.

"London, England",5,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,"Work-life balance: as a government role, one of the only places in the legal profession where it is possible to have a work-life balance . Overtime is rarely required unless working on particularly important projects, e.g. EU Exit or COVID in 2020. Even then, there are now moves to ensure this is properly compensated as opposed to an implied expectation like in private practice. 
Interesting work - the work is intellectually very interesting more often than not. Advisory lawyers often work at the forefront of novel government policy, advising on issues of public and tax law of which those in private practice can only dream. In litigation, lawyers will sometimes lead cases worth £billions. All lawyers are entrusted with a level of responsibility which is likely to be unfamiliar to anyone in private practice at less than partner level.
Culture - in my experience, the department is free from the shallow and superficial culture of most law firms. There is genuinely an acceptance of people for who they are and a tolerance of people from different backgrounds and neurodiversity. There is hugely less pressure to ""conform"" to a particular personality type (although different teams will inevitably develop their own subcultures to some extent).
Flexible working arrangements - home working is possible up to 40% of the time, which will possibly increase soon to 60%. Many people have bespoke working arrangements around childcare etc. There is no ""face-time"" culture.","Uncertain career progression - whilst promotion to Grade 7 remains guaranteed, the same is no longer true for Grade 6 (realistically the highest level most lawyers in government will achieve, unless they are among the few with ambitions to join the SCS). The promotion process relies on the Civil Service Competency Framework, which can be frustratingly vague to those who lack inside knowledge of what sort of answers interviewers are expecting to hear. It also seems to prioritise soft skills rather than legal ability, which results in many highly talented candidates struggling to achieve promotion despite them bringing a lot to the office (though this isn't necessarily that different to most law firms).
Poor office locations (London only) - due to decisions made by an ex-Chancellor decades ago, the main legal UK legal hub on the Strand closes in 2021 and lawyers will be expected to work in Croydon or Stratford once office working. Possibly as a result, there is increasing tolerance of working in other regional locations outside of London.

"Hastings, England",1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,best pro i found was leaving,"This is the worst job i have ever worked at in my life. The training process was great, Dan young gave me a advert for the great place this will be to work ( i was wrong) Once you're out of the training process another thing which was good was the academy period which lasted around 3 weeks with Dharon Pitt this was also a good advert. Unfortunately this was where it ended and the emotional destruction and, blackmail and micro management started. 

If a phone call comes in and they're not going to renew because they've sold there car so, don't require the insurance, this is your fault, WHY DIDN'T YOU RENEW THEM!! If someone rings through and they've told you twice they don't want to renew, make sure you badger them and harass them and stress the customer out because that's what you're told to do. or when a customer comes through and would like to speak to a manager, good luck trying to find one who can justify why they're paid more and actually take the call over from you, you will be told to say this and say that when really the customer would like to speak to the manager, either way it's your fault for even bothering the manager whilst they have a good catch up about social lives etc. 

When you have your 15 minuet break times don't you dare go 30 seconds over it because this will result in a good talking too and making you feel as though you are a child in school. i understand and appreciate someone being late but this is a new meaning. One thing that is great is the bribery, often when the managers or senior members of the staff need a good review in order to keep there job, they'll bribe you, what with? a Kit-Cat was mine, i was so excited i couldn't wait to write about how awesome the culture and workplace was here! if you renew 15 customers in a row without using any time to breath while standing on your head you earn yourself... a TV? Money? a car? no a celebration (not the box a single celebration) 

If you have any sort of mental health, anxiety, or any emotional imbalance avoid working here as a CR. this will finish you off. They often try to promote there 4C's message which is Colleagues, Customers, Company, Community. a great message which starts with colleagues meaning it will benefit the next part and so on, its a shame they done actually do this, if you're feeling down, get back on the phone, late for work due to a car crash, get back on the phone, if your whole family is in a life threatening situation, please please just get back on the phone. if you're feeling down, depressed, suicidal and would love to go home due to you not being able to reach your maximum potential...then please go you need it ( but just expect your disciplinary on your desk tomorrow) but please go if that's what you wanna do. 

i was often asked to stay past contracted hours in order to get through the call ques, despite this not being in my contract it was expected otherwise you should say goodbye to your job. You're also bombarded with awful stat expectations, and when you've had a good day? could do better, when you've had a perfect 100% day there is very little recognition or acknowledgment for this, I'm sure a lot of people who are under this pressure want a 100% day just so they don't have to hear the same broken record about how this is all because of you, you're not doing enough you're not saying what we told you, you didn't do this you didn't do that, be prepared to speak like a robot, but please add some character and personality in there (whilst you repeat exactly what we've said and follow a script) 

There is so many things wrong here, at first i felt i could've been harsh but no this is exactly how its run, it's a schoolground mentality with the managers thinking they're the teachers and own you but life changing consequences, which is loosing your job, I'm sorry to anyone who didn't see this and now works there and to anyone who's reading this and doesn't work here..Don't.",East Sussex,50.8553888,0.5824703,Urban with Significant Rural

"Bristol, England",1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,The HR team are so inadequate that I was able to be made redundant by noticing that they had not adhered to employment laws surrounding the redundancy process. Also had not honoured the reasons that they rejected my initial appeal (read: begging to be let go).,"Diligenta acquired my employment by being lucky enough to convince Lloyds to TUPE transfer my department and others over to them, effectively outsourcing their work whilst still reaping the benefits of keeping us to deal with their customers. Well, those benefits I'm sure have not been worth the hassle for the affected products in Halifax Financial Services, Clerical Medical and Scottish Widows. Their ""incredible"" system BaNCS is dreadful, slow, not user friendly, and the opposite of intuitive. They have strict processes for every requirement which are inflexible and work to the detriment of both customer, and call handler. By having offshore servicing teams the communication within the business to get things done right just falls apart, meaning things are often done wrong several times before it is fixed. 

After moving all the Lloyds Banking Group work from Bristol to Edinburgh (which was managed absolutely atrociously) we faced redundancy or relocation to Aviva who they also work for. The redundancy announcement came roughly a week before March's lockdown at the beginning of a global pandemic, which Diligenta must be very grateful for as it stopped the immediate haemorrhaging of staff who instead reluctantly stayed for the temporary job security - myself included. I was given the old bait-and-switch when I was unluckily moved over to Aviva, as on day 2 of my training, I was then informed the REAL role I would be doing was in an entirely different department to that which I was initially informed I would go into. Working at Aviva was not convenient to me, as it meant my office was now in BS34 instead of BS1 - which as you might gather is a fairly substantial distance which ate into both my wallet (now requiring public transport) and commute time. No financial reimbursement was offered to cover these or adjusted shift times. Diligenta values nothing more than a captive work force, and so I fought my move within Diligenta rather than resigned primarily because they seemed to welcome resignations as the cheapest way of letting the demoralised staff go. 5 months after the move to Aviva I was finally free to leave with redundancy, 13 months after the original announcement and now carrying the scars of deep stress, frustration, anxiety and depression over this time. 

At every point where it felt like normality had resumed after another change for the worse within Diligenta, we were struck with a new change with further ruptured the work environment - whether that was up-skilling without increased salary (ie, more work, same pay), refusal to level out pay discrepancies, increasing staff surveillance by managers, or adding new systems to increase the already burdensome number of different logins and bureaucratic steps needed just to do something like request holiday. They even asked us to download an app which would have a disturbingly wide range of unnecessary accesses to information stored on our personal devices, in order to log our hours despite these already being visible on other systems to the necessary lines of authority.

Internal progression is practically non-existent, they won't inform you if there is a salary increase involved prior to application for some internal moves, and it is a series of tick-box interviews/cover letters which does not actually look at any track record of achievement and so means the empty vessel sounding loudest will often regurgitate enough buzzwords to tick the boxes and get the job ahead of more qualified candidates. 

The above is by no means a complete list of issues within Diligenta, but are as much as I have the energy to outline. If you have other options I would highly recommend you take them before working at Diligenta. They would probably make for an adequate first job, but to echo the words of a manager formerly at Diligenta, don't stay longer than 1-2 years because it will slowly destroy you and will not offer suitable progression or pay rises to sustain any personal growth.",Bristol,51.4538022,-2.5972985,Urban with City and Town

Managers reacted really well to criticism from the team, changing the way in which they worked with us, and have consulted with us much better than before.

During the pandemic, BPP allowed all staff to work from home without question, except for the tiny minority they had to furlough until September 2020. It also looks like BPP will be offering much more flexibility in terms of working from home, which is excellent for members of staff like I, who have difficulties with mental health, and other health conditions, who have actually had a very positive experience working from home since March.

Although there are obvious, fair criticisms from a minority of students, BPP has dealt with the impact of the pandemic quite well, and has made appropriate changes to working practice. For example, all exams have been moved online until at least August 2021, which has given students some certainty. Additionally, BPP are running Covid-secure face to face exams for those who cannot use our online exam platform, which is excellent.","Some urgent work can be sprung on staff without any fair warning.

Lots of young, energetic employees, central location in the Arndale Tower.","The progression is largely determined by where you sit on the L B G T diversity template that has permeated this company's HR department above every other facet of common sense and consideration on how to run a HR function. If you arent flying that particular flag, you will be ignored and passed over with predictable & sickening regularity. Pay is ok for the basic work you do but it's not a career - if you want to earn less than £24k for the rest of your life this is a good place to stay. Perhaps the worse part of this job is management. They are mainly comprised of failed HR managers who werent industrious enough to get through their CIPD exams so they compensate by dragging junior members of staff into attendance & performance review meetings at every single opportunity. The phrase ""managed out"" springs to mind - any infraction for lateness (even if evidenced with events beyond your control) is punished with meeting after meeting, followed by gleeful team leaders savouring any opportunity to punish team members for such diverse reasons as childcare, bereavement, illness, etc, followed by further back to back meetings designed to undermine, torment & eventually bin employees off rather than solve problems and look at reasonable adjustments. For a HR department, they sure do make it up as they go along. The only real consistency I saw in this role is that backbiting, underhanded informing on your colleagues was encouraged and rewarded by manager's favouritism.

Since the new management took over, it has all gone downhill.
Extremely long hours, no work life balance, senior managers and directors email and message at all hours (earliest I got was 5am and latest midnight), even though they claim that ‘they are happy to discuss flexible working’. Flexible meaning, you have to be flexible and around.
Career progression is based on favouritism, or knowing that if they don’t promote, people will definitely leave, and people agreeing to get promotions without a raise with a semi-promise that they will get something the next year. Don’t ask for a raise, you won’t get it and you will end up 
 in their bad books.
The pay is low, the benefits are not great, except for the pension which is pretty good.
Don’t expect bonuses to be of much worth, and they stress that they are discretionary.
They don’t actually care about well-being, people being overworked and underpaid. It’s extremely difficult to get in lieu time for the extra time worked even if your manager knows that you have worked 10-12 hour days.
If you do decide to join, treat this as a temporary gig, most people leave after a couple of years, primarily the ones who are good at their jobs. The rest get promoted to fill roles that are incapable of doing.
Also, forget about training, there is literally no budget for that. They have an internal team who (bless them) do the best they can, but clearly are not going to be able to offer specialised training in areas outside the core bank roles.
Don’t make the same mistake I made to buy into the ‘culture’, it’s at best a facade. Who is left is some senior directors who have no clue what they are doing and destroying anything good left from the culture.",City of London,51.5073359,-0.12765,Urban with Major Conurbation

The Service Users were occasionally challenging but usually great fun to be around. 

Most of the staff I worked with are lovely, caring and diligent people, and I hope to stay in contact with several of them. 

The grounds were (once upon a time) beautiful.","Management - the attitude of some individuals stinks (others were very supportive). 

Communications are abysmal - top-down, one-way and inefficient beyond nightmare status. Newsletters, clearly designed for online distribution, are printed out and circulated behind a signing sheet. None of the houses had computers or printers, so everything was done on paper, and if you ran out of any forms on the weekend you spent more time trying to scrounge forms from other houses than filling the damn things in. When they eventually find their way 'upstairs' they are typed in to a computer and then apparently forgotten about.

Investment is awful. The fabric of the building and grounds were very poorly maintained - there were innumerable safety issues that we had to live with, such as broken lighting, doors hanging off of hinges, damaged door locks and self-closers, and constant issues with laundry and cooking equipment. The grounds have been let go to wrack and ruin.

The food prepared for the service users is sometimes embarrassing. Crappy ingredients coupled with weird menus and bizarre recipes put together by people whose skill level ran from 'chef' standard to worse than '1st-year-at-Uni'. The site deals with eating disorders but I never met anyone with any form of qualification as a nutritionist or dietician.

Career and professional development is treated as a burden. If you find a course to expand upon a special interest don't even waste your time applying for support or funding.

The worst thing is that the site manager at my location couldn't be bothered to talk to staff. When she does she is often rude. When she visits the service users she is often rude to them and nearly always provokes some kind of incident for the Support Workers to manage after she's gone. And she seems totally oblivious to her purpose (to care for her service users) and her biggest business issue (attracting and retaining staff).

One of my colleagues, who I had an argument with, was very close to a certain member of management and basically played it their way to make my life hell when I was there.

High turnover and everyone i spoke to in the team seems to want to leave due to being pushed away from HR and into essentially customer services. Very high volume of work with not enough people or experience to get it done, the work itself is unrewarding but stressful due to volume & SLA pressure. Performance measured only via SLA's which keep ticking during non working hours / weekends due to the ineffective system used, and don't really reflect the work being done. Focus is just get the cases closed before they breach SLA, whatever it's regarding. No benefits to working there, everything statutory. Almost no training provided; some processes explained in first few days but then largely left to figure it out on your own whilst the SLA's tick away and cases pile up.

There isn't any pay rise with this even though the amount of knowledge required, responsibility and pressure is a lot higher. This is because Supervisors don't technically exist in Sainsbury's anymore as everyone is meant to be trained to the same level, but nobody can be bothered to train everyone up that much and some people are not interested in having to learn so much.
On my last paycheck, they paid me £400 less than I was meant to receive, but they had locked me out of the HR centre where I would be able to view my paycheck as I was leaving. I was advised to call the HR department but they literally NEVER answer the phone. Only after a manager actually dealt with it did I get paid any more, but I was still paid £30 short. Getting hugely underpaid on your last month's paycheck is a really common issue, and Sainsbury's make it very difficult for you to chase up anyone about it.

I've now been in Commercial for 3 1/2 years and wow it's sometimes challenging, but it's a rewarding challenge. 

I've had the opportunity to complete educational courses and for this I'm glad I can say I continue to work for UU. 

Our Director is very approachable and so is every member of management including senior management, this also including the CEO. They all say hello in passing. This makes working for UU feel more like a family, I've gained many friends for life. On a night together we always have a time to talk about what's going on in work. This tells me that we all enjoy it, not many people want to talk work whilst out socialising (Pre-Covid!).

Overall, if you want a job for life sign up for the jobs page. All my friends always ask me how to join and some have been successful, keep trying and like I said with it's diverse work force a perfect job will soon appear.",Cons..There are no cons.

Big org, diverse environments to work in. Wonderful people and changeable pace, lots of best practice to learn from. It’s highly regulated, so you see what good looks like every day.

I enjoyed all the teams I worked with. Loved the different divisions and completely different operating models. I worked in many locations. Kingswood, Cardiff, Brighton, London and even regional partners.

I started as a Senior Finance Analyst and progressed to management fairly fast in 2 years. Being a business partner to multiple divisions across a few entities has given me some great insights into operating models, having some challenging projects to work on commercially and financially.

It’s hard to make a difference there; to have a voice and face. I managed to, but had to slog and really push change to sell it more widely. Shouldn’t be so hard to make things better.","In finance it’s hard to get up the chain into senior leadership there and regardless of skills, shining reviews, outstanding performance etc, restructures set people back year in year out, which is pretty awful; there’s a lot of competition from Group finance who are markedly more visible to leadership, so opportunities there is fairly static and staid. You just have to see how long people stay “finance managers” before becoming heads. Some 10 years, (reshuffled, relearn, reestablish, outperform, only to be displaced due to restructure to start all over again). When that happens to the superstars, you know there are issues. 

It’s poorly paid as well. For a FTSE it’s shocking. It’s not until you leave that you realise how bad the pay grades are. Pigeonholed in Finance, in middle management, during the most important time of your career to diversify and grow.

I left, took a seniority cut in different sector, (a charity at that) earning £10,000k more + 20% bonus, was promoted in new role within 6 months. Within a year promoted again as a head in FP&A and Business Improvements. So after pouring heart and soul into that company, to earn peanuts for 7 years at L&G as a high performing Finance Manager, within 4 years of leaving, 2 companies later, I’m now an Operations Director, with loads more experience and on track for a fulfilling career doing what I do best.

I interviewed at legal and general a couple years back in Hove. Unsurprisingly it seemed the world had stopped going back there. Even the tech and ways of working were the same. (Which filled me with dread given how much the world had advanced with MS Teams/interview techniques/tablets etc) I realised it’s a leviathan and will take tens of years to change process and senior leadership. It’s stifling. Systems are still same, ways of working are backward and unsurprisingly, I found myself questioning why I’d want to work there again after tasting what “excellent” looks and feels like.

I made it clear in the interview with them that I didn’t know loads about credit hire and that I’ve only ever done claimant work and not defendant. My manager knew this as he’s the one who interviewed me and gave me the job! He used to bully me so much. He used to make me feel so bad about getting things wrong, and never used to help me. He used to say ‘I have to think for myself’ - yet I said I was struggling with certain things and he never helped. He was constantly bullying me to the point that I got so depressed I had to have 6 weeks off work due to my mental health and multiple doctors appointments and notes! HR and my manager did a meeting with me whilst I was off claiming ‘they are here for me’ and as soon as I went back, my manager asked why I was off and he laughed at me! And told me ‘it’s just part of the job’ - it’s part of the job to be depressed and bullied by your manager? I don’t think so. This place is a joke. I complained about him and how he treated me and he just got away with it. No investigation into it or anything. My manager then had to the cheek to tell me I’m asking too many questions! Yet if I got the training I needed this wouldn’t have been the case! I’m asking too many questions? Would you rather me constantly get it wrong? What a joke. The place is laughable. Please save yourselves from this place. My mental health was one of the worst it’s ever been due to how I was treated here and they didn’t care. No investigation into him so I had no other choice but to leave. 3 months down the line after me leaving, they are saying I owe them money. They’ve changed this amount 3 times now. This place can’t be trusted. The management get away with bullying their staff, hence why they never actually take any of the job adverts down because their turnover is so high. There’s so much I could say about this place but I’d be here all day! All this for minimum wage too. Don’t put yourself through it.

The training is based more on how to use the software, rather than fixing issues which is 90% of the calls you take. The problems continue when you get onto Gradbay - they use a glide path system where targets become increasingly difficult week by week, until they become impossible. Unrealistic targets for Adherence, handle time, CSAT, after call work, as well as many more stats are used as a rod to beat you with. The culture at Sage is nothing short of abusive and cruel. Staff retention is GradBay is a disaster, with good reason.

Even managers are miserable, most likely due to being pressured by THEIR managers to get impossible results from a team with rock bottom morale. The hyper critical coaching style and micromanagement makes you feel like you’re completely useless if you’re not generating revenue for them on every call or pushing ‘self serve’ to paying customers. The intense focus is always on getting through as many calls as possible and to generate as many sales leads as possible means that you cannot deliver customer service and tech support to increasingly angry customers who are paying for the privilege of calling. My day would begin with tears and genuine panic attacks as I joined my morning huddle, which came to feel like a ‘name and shame’ opportunity for those who had ‘let the team down’ by taking too long handling calls, and those hadn’t met their sales targets the previous day.

Abuse from customers - screaming, swearing, personal remarks about your intelligence and personality - is not only tolerated, but the dedicated Customer Complaints team would rather lay the blame on the technician for ‘not taking control of the call’ and refuse to send out warning letters to repeatedly abusive customers. Hanging up on a screaming, abusive customer is classed as ‘call avoidance’ so will land you in hot water.

The ‘internal channels’ for reporting problems that are so often mentioned in by Sage in their Glassdoor responses are non-existent. I’m not sure exactly what I would even say on them if they did exist - Sage has a culture problem.

Once started in the role, discovered there was no job security whatsoever. This was both for the length of the job and the daily duties as well. Was told by the employer, who was a government body, that they cannot tell me what the job involves because it’s a secret and they would have to take it day by day?!

-small handful of genuine people there.","-Health and safety concerned when it suits, or when something awful happens they then do something. (Asbestos issue for years, which employees were worried about, ignored for years finally did something about it, Covid health and safety absolutely terrible. When people could work from home, they were told to come in regardless, even before goverment said to do so. and would lie as an excuse to something you couldn't do from home, even with compromise it wasn't good enough,.Will treat you differently to another admin in same department, social distancing didn't exist there, we were told to social distance, which I did, but then managers would fill small offices with about 15 staff. 

- compulsive liars, tell you something, or forge emails to blackmail you, or risk your safety. (Covid) 

-within a matter of months I went from a bubbly individual, who enjoyed their role, to someone with work related mental health issues, which has still left me with issues with confidence and paranoia (e.g they lied and made you feel there was make believe issues)

-Worse management skills ever, you mention mental health they then make it worse, by belittling you in front of others. any new 'processes' are left to the last minute with next to no training, and then told off for not following process.

-ever changing process, tell you one thing, next thing got to do it another way. genuinely this can be a monthly change, if someone from another department decides they dont want a part of their job, expect them to load that extra work onto you, whilst the other member does less work. but only if your face fits, if you don't like a side to your job, you can't load it onto someone else if your face doesn't fit.

-absolutely no way what so ever to progress in the company, well unless you're well liked regardless of your skill set. I was well liked for a while, until I raised health and safety concerns. 

-non managers walk round like they are managers, only because they are friends with a manager. 

-Belittled in front of senior manager who said they would help and support, yet doesn't help and support, you mention grievances and they encourage you not to do so because 'grievances don't get you anywhere'

-When you finally have a break down and get signed off sick, expect occupational health to phone you, which is great, but then say they will check in every 2 weeks, then never hear from them ever again. 

-Expect a annual redundancy rumour to do the rounds. redundancies were happening every year I worked there apart from one, but if you like living on the edge it's perfect.

-Literally no overtime, no incentives, expect them to squeeze every last bit of life out of you mentally, you may have a good few years, but expect a sudden shift, and watch them all turn against you. (this isn't just personal, although it sounds it, there have been many people who have left or had issues with any issue there, this is not a bias review) 

-oh and one last thing, even when you are gone, and the manager knows it was caused by their behaviour, they just do the same to someone else.

The pay - SAME AS TESCO, SAINSBURYS, ETC and they treat their workers 100x better. The shifts/ hours - Always changing, cannot plan your life, SHIFTS ARE RANDOM, 5-3am one day then 6-11pm the next. Contract hours are rarely stuck to unless you are a manager. For example, someone on 10 hours could do 35 in one week.
The Training – Learn everything on a computer course, colleagues are supposed to show you in real life, they do not, they are busy working understaffed stores. And then managers wonder why you know so little.
The work - Starts at 5AM. Frantically work heavy delivery until store opens without any breakfast or going to the toilet. If you do not complete your delivery in time you will be in trouble because you have to work them in a certain time, there is a lot to do for only a few people. Store opens, you will grab a till, Till 1-3 you will be scanning items as fast as you can through the belt the rest of your shift, at the end of the day YOUR FINGERS WILL BE NUMB AND HURT FROM THE AMOUNT OF TIMES AND SPEED OF GRABBING ITEMS THROUGH THE TILL - NO JOKE HERE. YOU WILL NOT HAVE TIME EVEN TO TALK TO CUSTOMERS BECAUSE OF HOW UNDERSTAFFED YOU ARE. If you are one of the other tills your life will be better as you alternate between shop floor and till. Evening shift starts after midday. If you are on till, then you will be on there until 10pm which is painful. You will speedily do your cleaning up jobs at the end of the day. Unrealistic targets are set for the end of the day, you will half do jobs because one man is not enough to do all of them in one hour. You will go home knackered and wondering why you even go to work. Break will be 30 minutes even on a 12-hour shift, 15 minutes on a 6- hour shift. It is no wonder most store colleagues are young men, they are the only ones who can handle the physical and mental stress. You can forget about any physical exercise you do all your energy will be used up at Lidl!!!
The colleagues - You will be to busy working to get to know anyone, some can be ****. 2 colleagues tried to fight with me, in the middle of store on 2 occasions and another one I knew would shout at customers.
The customers – Usually nice, they get annoyed when you don’t have enough tills, that isn’t your fault - it is the fault of Lidl because they do not employ enough staff. Sometimes you will not have any security so you will watch out for thieves whilst doing your other jobs!!
The managers – wish you had the same ability as 10 workers. Management at head office seem to have no idea about the realities of their stores, or maybe they do and do not care, because they pay homage to those above.
Lidl are a disgrace upon the retail industry, and they should be ashamed for how they treat their store employees. It is disturbing that a western company could operate like this at such a vast scale and get away with it!! Well I guess this is the doomed USA style capitalist ang globalized world we are heading for! Lidl should change the way they run their store operations, but they will not because someone somewhere is getting fat on cash from it. PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYES OF LIDL YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!! As a full time university student I can honestly say Lidl definitely contributed to me loosing my Funded Scholarship, due to the amount of crap I had to deal with this company my grades suffered.

Wages - shocking wages. I was paid by the hour and from the time I started working till my last day I only had an increase of about £1 in three years.

My second point, Black Friday week / Black Friday. You are worked to death, even on the customer service desk, where I worked. Both of the Black Fridays I worked whilst with Curry’s, I worked at least 13 hours on these days. 

Work promotions do not exist if you are a customer service rep in stores. The only way you can possibly be promoted into a higher position such as a team leader or manager, was to go into a sales role which meant you would be put under stupid pressure to hit targets which were sometimes if not a lot of the time, impossible to hit and you were also at the bottom of the pile for any promotion even if you were there for a good few years like me. 

I was stuck in a store with colleagues who could not give a damn about working there. With me being on the customer service desk, any issue, no matter how small, they would push on me and my colleagues to deal with, even if it was a case of they messed up on a sale or messed up on something else, we were expected to sort it out. 

Management only cared about the sale staff and that is saying something as they didn’t really care a lot about them either. 

The new holiday/roster system that came in before I left was shocking...even the old system of just printed out rosters on a wall was bad but this was worse. There was a period where I was rostered to work 12 days in a row. When I raised this with my manager, he didn’t care. He gave me 3 days off at the end but would not even toy wi try the idea of breaking my working days up and just had no interest at all. I saw people coming and going from their holidays and weekends and days off whilst I was still working. My 9th day went passed, then my 10th and 11th and finally my 12th with no break in between. This was me working 9 hours a day also with 2 hours of travelling to and from work.

Holidays, you are banned from putting in any holiday requests at all from the middle of November until the middle of January as this is a busy period. Only exceptional circumstances would allow for you to be on holiday. Even students who went home for Christmas would be expected to transfer to another store for how ever many weeks. 

I was expected to take abuse from customers every single day for stuff that was not my fault or even the companies fault yet i explained how we would move forward, a manager would get involved and tell them the complete opposite, undermining what I said making me feel like an idiot.",Sheffield,53.3806626,-1.4702278,Urban with Minor Conurbation

People on the career ladder only seem to care about money. Every action is targeted towards having highlights to say at end of year review in order to justify a big bonus or promotion.
Promotion is primarily based on time served and making friends with those above you.
Short term gain is put above long term gain. A quick decision is better than the right decision.
I saw and heard some very dubious actions, at best they were unethical, some possibly illegal.
They also don’t like junior staff challenging senior staff, it’s viewed as being “difficult” and “not collaborative”.
Very hierarchical, people like to appear senior so will try to keep hierarchical structures so they can say they had people report to them.
A lot of managers couldn’t manage and didn’t have a clue what they were doing. The resulting chaos usually results in junior staff working on stuff that isn’t necessary and doing lots of overtime.
There is surprisingly little processes and procedures.  How something gets done or what decisions gets made is largely up to whoever is on the job.
Pay is very asymmetrical, partners are on ridiculous salaries while those at the bottom can be quite low. Feel that senior people justify this as “time severed” and now they can get the rewards.",City of London,51.5073359,-0.12765,Urban with Major Conurbation

Well recognised brand for your CV.,"To understand Bloomberg’s culture, you need to understand Bloomberg’s business and operating model. Bloomberg is a monopoly in financial markets with flash marketing and thought leadership. The company is like an old oak tree, so far engrained into every fibre of the market, that it is impossible to rip out. Their monopoly is on the community (mainly the IB chat), which gives them an advantage over competitors, as clients trade on their platform and consume data. The reality is ‘The Terminal’ is an overpriced piece of Teletext. Much of what you get, is already available for free online, or for very little subscription cost, and most of the data is not even theirs; it is aggregated from other vendors. Most clients know this, but there is nothing they can do. If you are a bank – you make markets over Bloomberg, it’s that simple. Then every two years your 5% price increase letter arrives, leaving you wondering what exactly you are paying for. 

Management is a cult-like mafia. The company is still private and 84% owned by Mike Bloomberg himself. Loyalty to the cult is rewarded above all else. It is not a place where your ideas are welcome. There is a reason most of the Management are Bloomberg veterans (10+ years) and they do not hire external Sales people – toe the line or get out. 

Sales, or what they call ‘Sales’, is more like customer success indirect selling. The company operates a high touch model, with demanding quantitative targets; constantly bombarding clients with marketing spam, meetings etc. Reps become resourceful and cheat the system to keep Managers happy. Remuneration is not clear, hitting your targets doesn’t mean a pay check. Expect better bonuses in the back office of a bank, with the millions you sold being syphoned off to Bloomberg Philanthropies, or Mike’s $1bn vanity project i.e. his 2020 Presidential bid. 

Lastly, micromanagement, which is getting worse, due to COVID. Expect to be monitored on how many emails, calls, visits, demos, adoption of certain client criteria etc. The system is broken because too many people cheat the metrics and it becomes a dull existence constantly finding ways to keep up. They will even show the time you enter and leave the office, visible to all employees within the company. Everything is quantified and you are stacked against your peers, with year-end evaluations focusing on where you sit on the bell curve.",City of London,51.5073359,-0.12765,Urban with Major Conurbation

My manager was inexperienced and refused to hear any suggestion that I made. It felt really demoralising and frustrating. I reached out to other managers, friends from previous job who agreed that it was frustrating… but that’s it.
– I agree, this is a horrible situation.
– What can I do about it?
– I don’t know…
– Wait a year, so I can change teams?
– Maybe. That was changed to 18 months though.

All three of the Org, the project and my manager had ""the worst Pulse rating in the history of the company"" at their level, according to people who had been at Facebook longer. No one reached out.

- Opportunity to work on interesting projects in an interesting industry.","- Career progression is non-existent with both managers and HR to blame. HR constantly changes the framework every year and managers promote based on unfair criteria such as how friendly you are with them. Forget about salary increase, even for inflation, you will be served every fairy tale in the world to explain why that's not possible.
- The business changes directions every month or so which is not atypical for a startup, however, due to heavy regulations in the industry this makes everything move extremely slowly at ground level and you're stuck in a limbo state not being able to focus on actual work towards a goal.
- Benefits disappear suddenly such as the employee discount scheme, and engineers are provided with low specced laptops from three years ago to work on even though this is a unicorn.
- Heavy regulation impedes a lot of the engineering progress and results in a mess of useless processes to make a few people feel safe.
